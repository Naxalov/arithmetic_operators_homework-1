#Create a variable called 'number' and assign it the three-digit number.
number = 543
#Find the 'number' first digit and assign to x1.
x1 = number % 10
#Find the 'number' second digit and assign to x2.
x2 = number // 10 % 10
#Find the 'number' third digit and assign to x3.
x3 = number // 100 % 10
#Create a variable called 'answer' and assign it the sum of the three digits.
answer = x1 + x2 + x3
#print the sum of the three digits.
print(answer)
